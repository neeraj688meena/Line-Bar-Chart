1. You are expected to implement a line chart and bar chart using React and ECharts for React. The entire source code should be in TypeScript.
2. Wine Data Set to be used for visualization.
3. Line Chart to be drawn between “Flavanoids” on the horizontal axis and “Ash” on the vertical axis. The axes should be labeled.
4. Bar chart to be drawn showing the “Alcohol” categories on the horizontal axis and the minimum “Magnesium” value for each alcohol category on the vertical axis. The axes should be labeled.
5. In the final product, upon running yarn start, the browser should open with the desired charts rendered.
6. No other helper libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. should be sed.
7. No analysis of data is needed. Only the charts should be implemented.
8. JavaScript is also allowed if TypeScript is not known to you.
9. Remove all the unused code (JS, CSS, Test Files, etc) and libraries from the CRA template.
